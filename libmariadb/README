This is an LGPL MariaDB client library that can be used to connect to MySQL,
MariaDB, or SingleStore. It is included in the SingleStore ODBC driver.

It is based on libmariadb from the MariaDB Connector/ODBC 3.1.

That code was based on the LGPL libmysql client library from MySQL 3.23
and PHP's mysqlnd extension.

This product includes PHP software, freely available from
